## Installation
install chromedriver
find path to chromedriver
this is already done, but for actual release/deploy, we'll have to add actual instructions

pip install selenium


## Notes
There is an issue with reading all of the cards' data. You can see this in the get_world_rankings function.
I think it's something to do with event_sections, but maybe you'll see something different.
